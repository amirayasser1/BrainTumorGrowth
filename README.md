Project Overview

This project focuses on modeling brain tumor growth using the Fisher-KPP equation, a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE). The study involves segmenting tumor regions from DICOM medical images using U-Net, then estimating tumor growth rates by analyzing volumetric changes over time. The approach integrates computational modeling, medical imaging, and machine learning techniques to gain insights into tumor progression.
